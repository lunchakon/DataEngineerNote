##1.Data Preparation:

Import Libraries: Use pandas to read and manipulate the CSV data.

Read CSV: Read the CSV file using pd.read_csv(). Consider handling missing values, data types, and potential errors.

Cleaning and Transformation: Clean and transform data as needed. This might involve handling inconsistencies, removing duplicates, formatting dates, or creating new columns based on calculations.

Exploration: Use Pandas functions and visualizations to explore the data. This helps identify trends, patterns, and areas for further analysis.

##2.Analysis and Insights:

Calculations and Aggregations: Calculate metrics, perform aggregations (e.g., sum, average, group by) using Pandas functions.

Statistical Analysis: Use libraries like scipy.stats for statistical tests, correlations, etc.

Data Visualization: Create visualizations like charts and graphs using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly. These visuals can provide insights and facilitate communication with stakeholders.

##3.Report Generation:

Formatting and Storytelling: While Python can't directly generate pixel-perfect BI reports, you can format results (tables, charts) and combine them into a narrative using libraries like Jinja2 for 
templating. Alternatively, export data and visualizations for use in dedicated BI tools like Power BI, Tableau, or Qlik.

Scheduling and Automation: Can schedule Python scripts using tools like cron or Airflow to automate data processing and report generation at regular intervals.
