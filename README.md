Quick introduction to Data Engineering
What is Data Engineering

## Data Ingestion

Batch Data Ingestion
- Tools and techniques (e.g., Apache Sqoop, Talend)
  
Real-Time Data Ingestion
- Stream processing tools (e.g., Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis)

## Data Storage

Data Warehouses
- (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery)
  
Data Lakes
- (e.g., Hadoop, AWS Lake Formation)
  
NoSQL Databases
- (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)


## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes
- ETL Tools
- Data Transformation Techniques (Cleaning, normalization, aggregation)

## Data Modeling
Relational Data Modeling
- ER diagrams, normalization
  
Dimensional Data Modeling
