### Generative-AI-Road-Map
Step 1: Python Fundamentals

Make sure you're comfortable with Python basics: variables, data types, operators, control flow (if/else, loops), functions.
Libraries: Learn essential libraries like NumPy (numerical computing) and Pandas (data manipulation). https://numpy.org/doc/stable/ https://pandas.pydata.org/
Step 2: Traditional AI with Python

Machine Learning Fundamentals:
Understand supervised learning (classification, regression) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction).
Explore popular algorithms like Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
Libraries: Utilize scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library for Python. https://scikit-learn.org/
Practice with projects: Implement these algorithms on real-world datasets (e.g., classifying handwritten digits, predicting house prices).
Step 3: Deep Learning for Generative AI

Deep Learning Basics:
Grasp the concept of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and their structure (neurons, layers, activation functions).
Understand how deep learning learns through backpropagation.
TensorFlow or PyTorch: Choose a deep learning framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) and learn its core functionalities for building and training neural networks. https://www.tensorflow.org/ https://pytorch.org/
Step 4: Generative AI with Python

Generative Model Types:
Explore different generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
Understand their working principles and how they generate new data.
Generative AI Libraries: Utilize libraries like Keras (high-level neural network API) and TensorFlow Generative Adversarial Networks (TFGAN) for building and training generative models. https://keras.io/ https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan
Projects:
Start with simpler generative models like VAEs for text generation.
Gradually progress to GANs for image or music generation (these require more computational resources).
